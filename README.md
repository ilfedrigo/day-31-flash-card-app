# ilfedrigo Flash Card App

As part of my 31st day of the 100 days of code challenge in Python, I've created this simple flashcard application using the Tkinter library (not a big fan btw).

## Description

This Python application helps users memorize information through spaced repetition. 

The app displays flashcards with Japanese words on one side and their English translations on the other. 

Users can flip the cards, mark their answers as right or wrong, and proceed through the deck.


## How to Use

1. Run the application.
2. View a Japanese word on the front of the flashcard.
3. Click the buttons to indicate if your answer is right or wrong.
4. The app will dynamically adjust the flashcards based on your responses.

## Dependencies

- Pandas library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure Python and required libraries are installed.
3. Run the application using `python3 main.py`.
